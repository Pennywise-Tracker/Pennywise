# Pennywise

An expense tracker that lets users log spending simply by typing it out like a text message.

Behind the scenes, it uses text categorization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify the amount, the item, and automatically assign it to the correct category.

The app then compiles this information into clear summaries and insights, helping users spot patterns in their spending and make better budgeting decisions without the usual manual effort.
